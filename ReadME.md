#Biotechquester.io: Educational Web Game

**Biotech quester** is a third-person web-based educational game, which helps to explore the fields of biotechnology and chemical engineering. 

The game features customizable characters who can walk through immersive "zones" covering topics like:

- Agricultural biotechnology
- Pharmaceuticals
- Food and beverage chemistry
- Genetic engineering
- Bioenergy

## Frameworks and Languages

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla + Three.js for 3D rendering)
- **Backend**: Python with Flask (to handle user data and serve game logic)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (temporarily), later moved to a Flask-based server

## Project Initiatives

- Exploring biotech and chem-eng concepts while also acclimating to programming, both of which I aim to integrate and utilize in my future work.

- Blending character customization, exploration, and third-person gameplay to make scientific learning more enticing and adventurous through storytelling and mini-games.
