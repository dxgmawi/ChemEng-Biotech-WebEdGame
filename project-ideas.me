## Game Structure
- Start in a "Home Hub" where the player customizes a character.
- Walk into themed "zones" like Agriculture, Pharma, Food, etc.
- Experience different educational mini-games or quests (e.g., fixing a bioreactor, identifying GMOs) in each zone

## Planned Features
- Third-person movement in a 3D browser environment (Three.js)
- Simple decision-based games with visuals and sound
- Flask-based login + progress tracking (later)
- Fun fact pop-ups, quizzes, and challenge rewards
- Links to YouTube videos on relevant topics

## Inspirations
- Roblox/educational RPG games
- MIT Scratch zone logic
- Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell

## Target Audience
- High school students (Grades 8–12)
- Curious self-learners in biology, chemistry, and coding
